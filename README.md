# Image_generation
This is one of my trainings in DS &amp; ML: Image Generation (PyTorch)

This notebook shows three techniques for image generation:

-Saliency Maps: Saliency maps are a quick way to tell which part of the image influenced the classification decision made by the network.
-Fooling Images: We can perturb an input image so that it appears the same to humans, but will be misclassified by the pretrained network.
-Class Visualization: We can synthesize an image to maximize the classification score of a particular class; this can give us some sense of what the network is looking for when it classifies images of that class.
